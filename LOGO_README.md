# Logo Setup

## Save the Logo Image

Please save your logo image as:
```
public/images/logo.png
```

The logo image you provided should be saved in the `public/images/` directory with the filename `logo.png`.

## Logo Usage

The logo is currently used in:
- **Header**: 50px width (top navigation)
- **Home Page**: 120px width (welcome page)
- **Favicon**: Browser tab icon

## Steps:
1. Create the directory: `mkdir -p public/images`
2. Save your logo image as `public/images/logo.png`
3. The image will be automatically included in the build

## Alternative
If you don't have the logo file ready, you can:
- Temporarily use a different image
- Or remove the logo references in `src/App.tsx` and `index.html`
